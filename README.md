Excercise 1)

i)

Assume $x \succ x$. Then we have $x \succsim x$ but not $x \precsim x$. But this is impossible.

Assume $x \succ y$ and $y \succ z$. Then we have $x \succsim y$ but not $x \precsim y$ and $y \succsim z$ but not $y \precsim z$. Thus we must have $x \succ y \succ z$.

ii)

Assume $x \sim x$. Then we have $x \succsim x$ and $x \precsim x$ Which is true.

Assume $x \sim y$ and $y \sim z$. Then we have $x \succsim y$ and $x \precsim y$ and we also have $y \succsim z$ and $y \precsim z$. Thus we have $x \succsim y \succsim z$ and $x \precsim y \precsim z$. Thus we must have $x \sim z$

Assume $x \sim y$. Then we have $x \succsim y$ and $x \precsim y$. Thus we must also have $y \sim x$.

iii)

Assume $x \succ y \succsim z$. Then we have $x \succsim y$ and not $x \precsim y$. We also have $y \succsim z$ and $y \precsim z$. Thus we have $x \succsim z$ and not $x \precsim z$. Thus we have 
$x \succ z$
